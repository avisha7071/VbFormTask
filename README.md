# VB.NET CRUD Operations in Windows Forms

This project demonstrates how to implement basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a **Windows Forms** application in **VB.NET**. The application allows users to manage data by performing these operations on a local data structure or database. It is a simple yet powerful tool to manage records through an easy-to-use graphical interface.

## Features

- **Create**: Insert new records into the data store.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display existing records.
- **Update**: Modify data in existing records.
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted records from the data store.

- **Visual Studio** (with VB.NET support)
- **.NET Framework** (the version compatible with the project)
